<!-- The following properties (unlike those in version.props) are maintained manually.  So
     when there is a merge conflict, the highest version should generally be chosen, rather
     than keeping what's in the branch, which is the usual strategy with version.props merge
     conflicts.
       
     Basically: In this file, choose the highest version when resolving merge conflicts.
